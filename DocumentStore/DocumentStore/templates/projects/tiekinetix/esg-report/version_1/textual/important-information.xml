          <p>Furthermore, such forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases or oral statements made by or with approval of an authorized executive officer of TIE Kinetix N.V.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied in such statements.</p>
          <p>Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the information set forth in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>

          <p>Many of these factors are beyond TIE Kinetix’ control or ability to predict.

Accordingly, TIE Kinetix also refuses to accept any obligation to update statements made in this document.</p>
